# SNSF_200021_204196_datasets

Datasets that were created for/during the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) project 200021_204196

Due to the shear amount of data, some data is only available in processed form.
There, instead, the scripts and inputs used to generate the data are presented.

## Publications

Datasets used for publications are available in the folder [./publications](./publications/),
where they are structured as indicated in the respective README files.

## Questions/Problems

If you are missing something, or would like to request the original data and/or structures,
