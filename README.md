# SNSF_200021_204196_datasets

Datasets that were created for/during the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) project 200021_204196

Due to the shear amount of data, some data is only available in processed form.
There, instead, the scripts and inputs used to generate the data are presented.

The complete dataset and codes acquired in the process of this project (ca. 15 TB) 
are stored in the long term storage of ETH Zürich and can be acquired upon request.

## Publications

Datasets used for publications are available in the folder [publications](./publications/),
where they are structured as indicated in the respective README files.

## Software

Software produced and/or contributed to is documented in the folder [software](./software/).

## Questions/Problems

If you are missing something, or would like to request the original data and/or structures,
