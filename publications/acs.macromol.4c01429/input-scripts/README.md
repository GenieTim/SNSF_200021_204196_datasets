# Input Scripts

This folder hosts

- LAMMPS input script templates. These are input scripts to LAMMPS, but with certain placeholders (such as the structure path), in order to generate many identical input scripts for different input structures (since we repeated all simulations for at least 10 different structures)
- Python scripts to iterate the input structures/restart files and generate "final" LAMMPS input scripts.

Please note that the folder structure here is different from the original – adjust the paths everywhere as needed for your reproduction.
