# Data Generation

In this folder, you can find scripts to generate the data used to produce the plots present in the published article.

Please note that these scripts and codes have evolved during the evolution of the story and publication.
When running these scripts, you might end up with _slightly_ different results due to:
- system sizes,
- randomness in generator & entanglement sampling,
- solver configuration (stopping criterion),
- pylimer-tools version,
- MD vs. MC input structures,
