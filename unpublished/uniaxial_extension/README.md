# Uniaxial Extension Simulations of Polymer Networks

This folder contains scripts, input files and notes on uniaxial extension simulations of polymer networks.

In the folder [./pdms](./pdms), inputs and scripts for uniaxial extension simulations of PDMS networks can be found.
In the folder [./phantom](./phantom), inputs and scripts for uniaxial extension simulations of phantom networks can be found.

Note that in both cases, the LAMMPS input scripts are templates that require filling in parameters according to the specific system to be simulated.
Example shell scripts that were used to generate the actual input files are provided as well, though certain values and parameters have been adapted between different simulation campaigns.
