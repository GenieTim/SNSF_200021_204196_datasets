# Biaxial Extension Simulations of Polymer Networks

In the NVT ensemble used, biaxial extension simulations are identical to uniaxial compression simulations.
Thus, the scripts and inputs provided here are similar to those in the [uniaxial_extension](./../uniaxial_extension) folder,
with the main difference being the applied deformation protocol.
Refer to that folder for more details on the general setup.
